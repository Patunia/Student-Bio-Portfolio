        <p> I was born in communist Poland, and immigrated to the USA as a refugee through Canada when I was three and a half.
            I officially became a citizen when I was nine, and I changed my name from Patrycja to Patricia. In my Polish Passport
            I am still Patrycja. I wish I hadn't since I did it to avoid being outed as not-American, and it made literally no difference. I did not grow up in a Polish neighborhood, but I did go to Polish
            school reluctantly every Saturday morning. I grew up in Roscoe Village and I went to about seven different Public schools and one Catholic School  
            . I thought I'd grow up to be an Actress. That pretty much got derailed when I ran away from home in 8th grade.
            Along with two other teens, I hitchhiked and Grey Hound-ed it across the country, ended up in the following places: the Shoshone Spring Gathering,
            San Francisco, Crescent City, Eugene, and finally - Portland. San Francisco and Portland are definitely the best places
            to be homeless. I ended up in a movie (uncredited) as an extra in a few scenes. I can prove it. Anyway, Angelina Jolie was in it, I asked
            her for $5 one day and she was kind of weird about it and gave me her jacket instead. Instead of being
            grateful - I was irritated and threw the jacket away. LOL. I won't tell you about the bad parts of my adventure, but there were plenty.
            I definitely do not recommend being 13 and a runaway. I learned
            that life wasn't that much better on the streets, so I turned myself into the police, went to Juvie and then got back home
            in time to graduate eighth grade. Sometimes I think about writing to Angelina Jolie to let her know it took a while,
            but I turned out OK, actually way more than OK. And to thank her for the jacket.
